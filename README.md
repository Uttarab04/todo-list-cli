# Summary

To-Do List Manager is a Python-based terminal application that helps users add, view, remove and  manage tasks. It uses lists and dictionaries to store task data, and performs file I/O to save and load tasks from a text file. The application supports adding task titles and descriptions, viewing tasks, and removing tasks by number. Error handling is built in to manage file-related issues and user input mistakes. This project helped reinforce Python fundamentals including control structures, functions, file operations, and data structures, while introducing clean coding practices and user interaction in a CLI environment.
